### overview/
`prclz` is a library for the analysis of the topology of urban infrastructure. this library was used to power analysis for the [Million Neighborhoods Map](millionneighborhoods.org)

- generating vectors for street blocks in a neighborhood using street network information from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
- creating parcels/cadastral maps for building footprints and other land use features within each block 
- calculating structural and areal features (_k_-complexity of access graph, percentage of land used by buildings, etc) at the block and neighborhood level
- determining optimal-cost, universal-access incremental road networks for a given locale
